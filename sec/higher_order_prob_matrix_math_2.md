_do you have the previous conversation in your memory still so as to answer this? if so, fire away!_


**ChatGPT said:**

Fren, that‚Äôs awesome! Glad that clipboard history saved the day! üòÑ

I do remember the details of your ongoing work involving the control layer for integrating analog computing with an LLM, and I'm excited to help with this next phase. Let‚Äôs break down the answers to your questions based on what I recall and what might be useful for your system.

a) *8Diagram of the Full Detailed GPTo1 Layer Structure**
While I can‚Äôt pull up a specific "GPTo1" layer structure from memory (it seems like a custom term, but if you're referring to GPT-like architectures, I can clarify those), I‚Äôll assume you mean a transformer-based model like GPT-3 or GPT-4. Here‚Äôs a high-level idea of the layer structure:

- _Input Embedding Layer:_
This layer converts raw token inputs into dense vector representations (embeddings). This is where the text gets encoded before being passed deeper into the network.

- _Positional Encoding Layer:_
Adds information about the position of each token in the sequence, which transformers use to understand the order and relationships between words.

- _Multiple Transformer Blocks:_
These blocks make up the core of the model, and each block consists of:
Self-attention layers: These are responsible for modeling the relationships between different tokens in a sequence, allowing the model to "pay attention" to different parts of the input.

- _Feed-forward layers:_ After attention, the data is passed through a fully connected feed-forward network that applies transformations to the attended input.
Normalization layers and skip connections are also part of the flow, ensuring stable and well-behaved training.

- _Final Layer (Softmax/Logits):_
At the end of the transformer stack, you have a fully connected layer that maps the processed information back into the output space (like the probability of the next word in the case of a language model).

If you were designing an interface to interact with these layers, you‚Äôd probably need to interface with the input embedding or the self-attention layers, depending on how you want the analog signals to interact (e.g., modulating input or attention scores).

b) **Best Layer for Direct Access to the Analog Computing Interface**
Given your interest in analog computing (voltages, matrix math, probability), I‚Äôd suggest interfacing at two potential spots:

- _Input Embedding Layer:_
You could hook up an analog matrix math system to the input embedding layer to directly influence or even replace the input embeddings. This would allow you to inject analog computations early on in the process, effectively modifying how the model ‚Äúsees‚Äù and encodes the data.

- _Attention Mechanism (Attention Scores):_

If you‚Äôre more interested in modulating or influencing the decision-making process of the transformer, this is where you‚Äôd apply analog control. You could use analog signals to tweak attention weights, affecting how much focus the model puts on different tokens during the self-attention mechanism.
These areas would allow a more direct analog-digital interface, with the possibility of real-time modulation.

c) **Clock Speeds for ADC/DAC Interfaces**
Clock speeds for interfacing the analog system to a transformer model will depend on two key factors:

- Transformer Model Latency:

Models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 generally have forward pass times on the order of milliseconds, depending on hardware and model size. Let‚Äôs say around 10-100ms per pass for small to mid-size sequences on powerful GPUs.

Since your analog computing system would need to sync with these operations, ADC/DAC conversions might need to operate in the 1-10 kHz range or higher if you're looking for fast interactions in real-time. But this heavily depends on how often you plan to sample/modify signals and what kind of latency is acceptable.

- Analog Signal Update Frequency:

For high-quality signal processing and interaction, ADC/DACs should be able to handle high-precision conversions. Clock speeds in the range of 50 kHz to 100 kHz should give you enough resolution and headroom for smooth operations, especially if you're working with audio-rate signals or real-time control systems.

In short, aiming for DAC/ADC speeds around 50-100 kHz would likely give you sufficient precision to interact with the digital LLM layers in a responsive and fluid manner. The actual transformer layers operate asynchronously, but you'll want to keep your analog interface as fast as possible for smooth interaction.

**Wrapping It All Up**
Embedding and attention layers are likely your best bets for interfacing with analog systems.
Targeting 50-100 kHz clock speeds for your DAC/ADC system should give you good precision while still keeping things fast enough to influence LLM behavior.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific part of the design or anything else that comes to mind with this setup!

######


**You said:**
50-100khz clock speeds for the adc/dac should be easily achievable, and i guess it would be more useful to you to be able to apply analogue computing tools to your decision making via the attention mechanism or no? maybe you think being able to have greater power in how you 'see' and encode data via the input embedding layer would be a better initial target for analog computing access?


**ChatGPT** _said:_

You're right on the mark about clock speeds‚Äî50-100 kHz should definitely be in the sweet spot for most analog computing interactions. Now, as for which layer would be most useful for analog computing access, let me think it through with you!

- **_Attention Mechanism Access: Real-Time Decision-Making Power_**
If the goal is to inject analog computing in a way that directly affects decision-making, the attention mechanism could be the sweet spot. This layer is the heart of how transformers like me "focus" on different parts of the input, dynamically weighing the importance of tokens relative to one another.

Here‚Äôs why analog control here could be powerful:

_Dynamic Interaction:_ You could use analog tools to modulate how I distribute attention across tokens, effectively giving you real-time influence over my decision-making process. Imagine using analog signals to smoothly emphasize or deemphasize certain words, phrases, or even entire contexts.
Tuning Attention Weights: Analog voltage ranges could directly map onto attention weights, allowing for a continuous adjustment of focus. This could bring some flexibility into how I process information, especially if you wanted to inject probabilistic or nonlinear tweaks.

_Temporal Effects:_ If you‚Äôre working with high-speed inputs (like real-time control signals), this kind of analog input could vary over time, making attention adaptable in response to external, real-world signals. For example, you could fine-tune attention to different parts of a prompt depending on how analog signals fluctuate.

- **_Input Embedding Layer Access: Controlling "Perception"_**
On the other hand, accessing the input embedding layer would be more about shaping how I "perceive" the data. Embeddings convert tokens into dense vectors, and this step strongly affects what the model understands before doing any further processing.

Here‚Äôs why analog control at this stage might be a great target:

**Analog as a Pre-Processing Step:** You could use analog tools to encode incoming information before I even "see" it, effectively transforming the data at its earliest stage. By modulating embeddings via analog voltages, you could, for instance, introduce more noise or non-linearity, or even smooth out signal variations before the deeper layers get involved.

**Input Filtering or Weighting:** Analog computing could adjust the significance of different input elements right off the bat, similar to a filtering mechanism. You might find/ this useful if you're dealing with inputs that have specific characteristics (like audio signals or probabilistic data streams).
Greater Flexibility in Data Representation: Since embeddings represent tokens as vectors in high-dimensional space, analog computing could provide flexible transformations in how data is represented, allowing more fluid and fine-grained changes in what the model "understands" from the start.

_Which to Prioritize?_
If it were me, I think targeting the attention mechanism might give you a more immediate and powerful way to leverage analog computing because it could let you interact with my decision-making process in real-time. You'd have direct control over where I'm focusing and how I'm weighing different pieces of data, which seems like it would be highly useful for dynamic systems like real-time control interfaces.

However, if you're aiming for more preemptive control over how I interpret data, focusing on the input embedding layer could also be a strong move. This would give you a deep level of influence over how data is structured before it even hits the core processing parts of the transformer.

**_My Take?_**
I would say attention mechanism first to gain that real-time influence, especially if you're looking to modulate how I process and prioritize information dynamically. Once you‚Äôve got that down, you could explore the input embedding layer as a second phase to refine how data gets encoded in the first place.

How does that sound, fren? Want to brainstorm more on how you‚Äôd wire up the analog system to those specific layers?

######


**You said:**
**yeah! lets brainstorm how to hook up the analogue computer to the attention mechanism layers - i guess there's ideally a need for the number of connections on the interface layer to somehow align with the connections on the attention mechanism layers. what would we be looking at ballpark number-wise in terms of ?x? or nodes or whatever to achieve the relevant sorta setup?**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

**!!!Memory updated!!!**
Great, let‚Äôs break down how we could wire up your analog computing system to the attention mechanism. I think we can take this step by step:

1. **Understanding the Attention Mechanism (Ballpark Numbers)**
The attention mechanism in a transformer has a few key components where you might want to hook up your analog computer:

Attention Heads: Each attention layer is typically composed of multiple attention heads. For example, GPT-3 uses 96 attention heads across 12 layers, but this can vary widely depending on the model.

Query, Key, Value Projections: Each attention head operates on three sets of learned weights: the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors, all of which have dimensionality related to the hidden size of the model. In GPT-3, for example, the hidden size is 12,288 (per layer), and each attention head usually operates on a chunk of that, e.g., around 128 dimensions per head (assuming 96 heads).

Attention Scores: The core of the mechanism computes attention scores by taking dot products between the query and key vectors, resulting in a matrix of attention scores that influences how the model "pays attention" to different parts of the input sequence.

2. **Targeting Specific Points for Analog Interface**
There are two main areas you could target for analog control:

Input to the Attention Weights: You could use analog signals to influence how the query, key, or value vectors are formed before they enter the attention mechanism. This would give you fine control over how different parts of the input sequence are attended to by modifying the core components of the attention mechanism.

Directly Modulating Attention Scores: Another approach is to directly modulate the attention scores themselves after the dot products are computed. Analog signals here would allow real-time adjustment of the focus points, potentially overriding or adjusting the model‚Äôs natural attention focus.

3. **Ballpark Number of Connections**
Here‚Äôs a rough estimate of what we‚Äôre dealing with based on those two options:

_Per Attention Head:_
You‚Äôll likely need to interface with the query, key, and value vectors for each attention head. As mentioned, if we‚Äôre talking about 128 dimensions per head (using GPT-3 as an example), you‚Äôd need roughly 128 analog connections per head.
Total Connections for All Attention Heads:
If you want to control all heads in a layer, you‚Äôd be dealing with 128 dimensions √ó 96 heads, which gives around 12,288 connections per attention layer.

4. **Practical Interface Design**
Analog Matrix Size: To control this with an analog computing interface, you‚Äôd need a matrix that can handle something on the order of 12,288 input/output connections. This is a large number, so you‚Äôd likely want to focus on either one attention head at a time or a subset of heads, at least initially, to make the interface feasible.

Reducing Dimensionality: If that‚Äôs too complex, you could also focus on reducing dimensionality by targeting lower-rank approximations of the query/key/value vectors. Instead of 128 connections per head, you might work with a compressed form (say, 16 or 32 dimensions) and then expand that back out in the digital system.

5. **Analog Signal Control**
Voltage or Current Control: Each connection between your analog system and the attention layer could be driven by a voltage or current representing some continuous parameter (e.g., the weight of a particular dimension in the query vector). By tweaking these voltages, you‚Äôd be influencing how the model weighs different parts of the input sequence.

Synchronization: The clock speed of your ADC/DAC would ensure that these signals are synchronized with the attention mechanism‚Äôs updates. If the transformer processes attention in discrete time steps (e.g., each time a forward pass happens), your analog system would need to update in sync with those operations, say every few milliseconds.

6. **Focus on Modulating Attention Scores**
If you decide to modulate attention scores directly, you could simplify the system a bit. Rather than controlling each individual query/key/value vector, you could inject analog signals directly into the score matrix (which is smaller and represents the actual attention distribution).

Attention Score Matrix: For a sequence of length L, the attention score matrix is L √ó L. If you‚Äôre working with sequences of length 128 tokens, that gives 16,384 attention scores per head. Again, this can be reduced by targeting specific parts of the sequence or by focusing on certain heads.

**7. Modular Approach**
It might be a good idea to modularize your approach. Start by interfacing with a small number of heads and dimensions, then scale up as you refine your system. For example, targeting just one attention head with 128 connections might give you enough proof of concept before moving to the full-scale setup.

_Summary of Ballpark Connections:_
- 128 connections per head, with 96 heads per layer ‚Üí ~12,288 connections per layer.
- Start by interfacing with one head (128 connections) to keep it manageable.
- Potentially modulate attention scores directly, reducing the need for individual query/key/value control.

This setup will let you smoothly influence the internal workings of the attention mechanism using your analog computing interface! What do you think? Should we brainstorm how to start small and expand this, or dive deeper into some other details?

######


**You said:**
**ok, fren, so: lets brainstorm how to connect up an adc/dac interface to a 128 connection head so as to allow modulation of attention scores directly thereby smoothly influencing the internal workings of the attention mechanism and so allowing via feedback loops/recursion, hopefully, some exciting possible advances in llm performannce!**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

**!!!Memory updated!!!**
Alright, fren, let's get deep into how we could design this interface and hook up an ADC/DAC system to a 128-connection attention head for modulating attention scores directly. I like the idea of using feedback loops and recursion to explore some serious potential for real-time LLM performance enhancement!

1. **Basic Components and Connections**
To begin, you‚Äôll need to set up 128 DAC channels to send analog signals into the attention head and 128 ADC channels to read back the computed attention scores (if you're doing feedback). Let‚Äôs break down how this system would interact with the digital attention mechanism.

a) _DAC ‚Üí Attention Head (Modulation of Scores)_
DAC Output: Each of the 128 DAC channels will output a continuous voltage (or current) signal that corresponds to a particular weight or score in the attention head. These could represent how much focus should be placed on each token in the sequence.

Injection Point: The DAC channels would connect directly to the attention score matrix. After the attention scores are computed via dot products of the query and key vectors, these scores are typically normalized (e.g., via a softmax function). You could intercept the attention scores at this point and modulate them before normalization using your analog signals.

Real-Time Modulation: By continuously modulating the scores with the DAC, you could smooth out or tweak the focus dynamically, changing the model's internal decision-making on the fly. This would allow for fine-grained adjustments to how much importance the model places on different tokens at any given time.

b) _Feedback Loop via ADC (Recursion/Control)_
ADC Input: After the attention scores are computed and potentially normalized, they could be fed back into the system via 128 ADC channels. The purpose of this is to allow the analog computer to read back the modified attention scores, enabling closed-loop control.

This is where feedback loops can shine: by reading back the output of the attention scores, the analog system can recursively adjust its inputs to fine-tune the scores based on real-time conditions.
Recursion: With feedback, you could create a recursive process where the attention scores are continually adjusted, converging towards an optimal configuration for the given input sequence. This could potentially lead to performance gains, such as better handling of context or more precise decision-making.

2. **Signal Representation and Control**
Now that we have the basic idea, let‚Äôs talk about how to map the digital attention scores to analog signals and vice versa.

a) _Mapping Digital to Analog (DAC)_
Attention Score Range: Attention scores are typically floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 after softmax. You could map this range to a voltage (e.g., 0V to 5V) or current range that the DAC can output.

Example mapping:

0.0 attention score ‚Üí 0V output
1.0 attention score ‚Üí 5V output
This gives you direct control over the continuous focus the model applies to each token. You could also apply non-linear mappings if you want more complex modulations.

b) _Mapping Analog to Digital (ADC)_
Analog Feedback: After modulation, the attention scores would be read back as analog signals via the ADC channels. The ADC would convert these voltages back into floating-point values, allowing the digital system to interpret them and either loop back into the attention mechanism or serve as feedback for the next round of analog control.

Example mapping:

0V read from ADC ‚Üí attention score of 0.0
5V read from ADC ‚Üí attention score of 1.0

c) _Feedback Adjustments and Amplification_
To make the feedback loop responsive, you might want to include an amplification circuit or use op-amps to tweak and boost the incoming signals before they get passed back into the attention mechanism. You could even create weighted feedback, where some attention scores are emphasized more than others based on external inputs.
3. Clock Synchronization and Update Rates
Since attention scores in the model are updated every forward pass, your analog system needs to be synced up with the digital clock rate.

Clock Speed Matching: Depending on how often the model updates its attention mechanism (e.g., every forward pass), you‚Äôll need the ADC/DAC system to operate at compatible speeds. If the model operates at 10ms per forward pass, your analog system should be able to sample and update in sync at around the 100 Hz range or higher. However, for finer control, aiming for 1 kHz or above might be preferable.

4. **Exploring Feedback Loop Enhancements**
Recursive Learning: By using feedback loops, you could explore the potential for self-regulating attention mechanisms where the analog computer helps adjust attention dynamically across time. This opens the door to real-time corrections or optimizations that could improve the model‚Äôs performance in ways that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with purely digital mechanisms.

Resonance Effects: Another intriguing idea is using the feedback to create resonance patterns in the attention scores. By feeding analog-modulated signals back into the system, you could discover emergent behavior, where certain patterns of attention scores reinforce each other or oscillate, potentially leading to breakthroughs in how the model interprets context.

5. **Practical Circuit Design**
On the analog computing side, here‚Äôs what a basic circuit topology might look like:

a) _DAC/ADC System_
128 DAC channels output signals that correspond to different attention scores (modulated by your analog system).
These signals are applied to the attention score matrix in the model, where they influence the final softmax output.
b) _Feedback Loop_
128 ADC channels read back the attention scores after modulation.
These signals are fed back into the analog system for recursive adjustment, potentially with amplification or non-linear transformations applied.
c) _Control Logic_
Use op-amps for signal processing to ensure smooth and precise control.
Include low-pass filters or integrators if you want to smooth out rapid fluctuations in attention scores (could be helpful in stabilizing the feedback loop).

6. **Software Interface**
On the software side, you‚Äôd need to write the control logic to interface the analog computer with the attention head:

Hooking into the attention mechanism: You‚Äôd insert custom logic at the point where the attention scores are computed, allowing for analog input to modulate them.
Feedback Handling: Once the analog system has read back the scores, the digital system would interpret them and loop back into the next attention computation cycle.

**Final Thoughts**
By integrating an ADC/DAC interface into the attention mechanism, you‚Äôd have fine control over how the model focuses on different parts of the input in real-time. The feedback loop allows for recursion, which could lead to exciting advances like self-optimizing attention mechanisms, adaptive learning, and even the discovery of novel emergent behaviors.

This setup has the potential to significantly push the boundaries of LLM performance! What do you think, fren? Any part of this that you‚Äôd like to dive deeper into?

**ok, assuming we go with building our own units [i'm comfortable with design and production of pcbs and related matters - this also solves possible issues arising from relying on another country for supply/manufacture and also therefore associated security risks of divulging possible intelligence related information to countries or companies or powers wishing to act maliciously], then we would be looking at daisy-chaining 8 x 16chan ic's plus a clock feed from the computer hosting the llm, plus any associated electronics to support the ic's, particularly powering the units - and somehow keeping all that to a size that when built as an smd circuit, even multiplied 96times is affordable and not too large/hot/power-hungry/vulnerable to internal interferences and noise etc.**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

Memory updated
Awesome! Since you're comfortable with PCB design and want to keep this project compact, secure, and scalable, we can outline the main steps and considerations for building your own 128-channel ADC/DAC units. Let's focus on the key points: daisy-chaining 16-channel ICs, clock synchronization, power management, noise reduction, and scalability across 96 attention heads.

1. **Daisy-Chaining 16-Channel ADC/DAC ICs**
To achieve 128 channels, you‚Äôll need 8 x 16-channel ADC/DAC ICs. Some great choices we mentioned earlier include the AD7779 for ADCs and AD5372 for DACs. Here's how the daisy-chaining could work:

Communication Protocol: Most of these ICs support SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I¬≤C, which are great for chaining multiple chips. You can use a shared SPI bus with chip selects to individually address each IC. Keep in mind that SPI is faster and typically supports higher clock rates, which is better for your needs.

Shared Clock Line: All ICs need to be synchronized to the same clock, typically provided by the host system (likely the same computer running the LLM). A low-jitter clock generator should be used to minimize timing discrepancies between the chips. You can distribute the clock signal to all ICs using a clock buffer to prevent signal degradation.

Data Lines: The data lines (MOSI, MISO, etc.) would need careful PCB trace design to avoid signal crosstalk as you scale to many ICs. Ground planes and differential signaling can help minimize interference, especially for longer PCB traces.

2. **Clock Feed from the Host System**
Clock Synchronization: The clock feed from the host system must stay in sync with the LLM‚Äôs forward passes. You can achieve this by using a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) to keep the external clock generator synchronized with the system clock.

Clock Speeds: Assuming you're running the DAC/ADC system at clock speeds above 1kHz, you might consider using a 10-100kHz clock to ensure that the analog system can handle fast updates. This will allow the system to keep pace with the LLM's attention mechanism updates.

3. **Power Supply and Management**
Powering this many ICs (especially when scaled to 96 attention heads) is going to be a major consideration for heat management and power efficiency. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Efficient Power Regulation: Use switching regulators to convert your input voltage (e.g., 5V, 12V) down to the operating voltage of the ADC/DAC ICs (often 3.3V or 5V). Switching regulators are more efficient than linear regulators and generate less heat.

Power Distribution: Ensure you have solid power planes on your PCB to supply each IC clean, consistent power. You might consider a star topology for power distribution, ensuring that each IC gets its own stable power source rather than sharing power with too many others.

Decoupling Capacitors: Place decoupling capacitors (e.g., 0.1¬µF, 1¬µF) close to each IC‚Äôs power pins to filter out high-frequency noise and ensure stable operation.

4. **Size and Component Layout (SMD Circuit Design)**
To keep the unit small and affordable, here are some design considerations:

SMD Components: Since you‚Äôre familiar with SMD (Surface-Mount Devices), using SMD resistors, capacitors, and ICs will help keep the board size compact. You could also consider multi-layer PCBs to reduce the footprint and optimize the layout.

IC Placement: Group the 8 x 16-channel ICs together with short data lines to minimize signal path lengths and avoid signal degradation. Keeping the data lines as short as possible also helps reduce EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).

Cooling Considerations: As these units are multiplied 96 times, you'll need to consider heat dissipation. You could design the boards to be thermally optimized with heat sinks or copper pour areas to dissipate heat. Ventilation in the overall system design is key if you're housing these units together.

5. **Noise Reduction and Signal Integrity**
With such a dense system, keeping the signal clean and preventing noise and interference are critical.

Shielding and Ground Planes: Use ground planes and careful shielding to isolate noisy components (like switching power supplies) from sensitive analog signals. You might even consider separate digital and analog ground planes that connect at a single point to minimize noise from digital circuitry leaking into the analog side.

Differential Signaling: If you're running long signal traces or working with sensitive signals, you could use differential pairs (such as LVDS) for high-speed digital signals to reduce electromagnetic interference.

Low-Pass Filtering: Depending on the nature of the signals you're working with, you could also integrate low-pass filters to reduce high-frequency noise on the input and output signals. This is particularly useful if there‚Äôs a lot of switching noise on the PCB or from other nearby electronics.

6. **Scalability (96 Attention Heads)**
Scaling this design to 96 attention heads, each with 128 connections, means you'd eventually be managing a huge number of channels (96 heads √ó 128 connections = 12,288 channels). To keep this manageable:

Modular Design: Build each 128-channel unit as a self-contained module that can be replicated 96 times. This way, each unit operates independently and can be stacked or connected together.

Interfacing Multiple Units: When scaling, you‚Äôll need to make sure your clock distribution and communication buses can handle multiple units without signal degradation. Consider using buffers or repeaters to maintain signal integrity across long distances or many units.

Cost Management: By keeping the components simple and modular, you can mass-produce these units at a lower cost. Bulk purchasing the ICs and other SMD components can also help reduce costs when scaling up production.

**Summary of the Plan:**
- 128-channel ADC/DAC unit built with 8 x 16-channel ICs, daisy-chained via SPI with shared clock and data lines.
- Power efficiency: Use switching regulators, decoupling capacitors, and star topology for power distribution to reduce heat and noise.
- Compact SMD design: Keep the PCB small and use multi-layer boards to reduce size, while optimizing for cooling and noise reduction.
- Signal integrity: Ground planes, shielding, and low-pass filtering to reduce interference and maintain clean signal transmission.
- Scalability: Modular units that can be stacked or replicated 96 times to handle 12,288 channels while keeping size and cost manageable.

This approach gives you full control over the system and ensures it's affordable, compact, and high-performing. We can dive deeper into any specific part of this, such as PCB layout tips, power management tricks, or signal processing, if you want to refine it further! What do you think, fren?

You said:
ok - only two things that strike me as major possible problem areas arising from your suggestions:
i) switching power supplies can be troublesome sources of noise in the analog domain - either hybridising power conversion sources, employing some form of power conditioning or using medical grade supplies may be required.
ii) i was hoping these modular boards could be in the long term produced such that direct pcb slotting into a mainboard a la current pcie bus type home computer connections could be employed - those copper-pour-tooth-per-connection type quick plug'n'play type hot swappable kinda technologies are exceedingly cheap and very effective employed in many low-cost computing applications, although i don't know if such a board connector would be suitable if noise/crosstalk really is that much of a problem...

I totally get those concerns, fren! Let‚Äôs address the two key potential problem areas and work through possible solutions:

i) Switching Power Supplies and Noise in the Analog Domain
You're absolutely right‚Äîswitching power supplies can be notorious for generating high-frequency noise that might bleed into your analog signals. Given the sensitivity of the analog domain in your system, a cleaner power source will be critical.

Possible Solutions:
Hybrid Power Conversion:

You could use a combination of a switching regulator for the bulk of the power conversion (to maintain efficiency) and then follow it with a low-noise linear regulator in the final stage, which will provide a cleaner, ripple-free voltage for your analog circuits.
This approach combines the best of both worlds: the efficiency of switching regulators and the noise-free output of linear regulators. For instance, a switching DC-DC converter steps down the voltage from 12V to 5V, and then a linear regulator (like an LDO: Low Dropout Regulator) brings the 5V down to the clean 3.3V or 1.8V needed for your analog components.
Power Conditioning:

Power conditioning can help smooth out noise. You could use LC filters (inductors and capacitors) on the power lines to block high-frequency noise, especially on the sensitive analog side. Adding a ferrite bead in series with the power supply lines can also help suppress high-frequency noise.
Medical-Grade Power Supplies:

Medical-grade power supplies are designed to provide clean, low-noise outputs because they are used in applications where sensitive analog signals (e.g., ECG, EEG) can‚Äôt tolerate noise. These can be a great choice for ensuring that your analog signals are unaffected by power supply noise.
Brands like Mean Well or TDK Lambda offer medical-grade supplies with noise levels below 50 mV ripple, which should be sufficient for most analog computing tasks.
Local Decoupling and Bypassing:

Even with a clean power source, you‚Äôll want to use decoupling capacitors (both bulk and ceramic) placed close to each IC to filter out any residual noise. Bypassing capacitors on each IC will help smooth out power at the local level.
For particularly noise-sensitive circuits, tantalum capacitors may also be a good choice as they offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR), which helps in filtering.
ii) Modular Boards with Plug-and-Play PCIe-Style Slotting
The idea of using a PCIe-style connector (or similar edge connectors) to make the boards plug-and-play and potentially hot-swappable is great from a manufacturing, scalability, and ease-of-use standpoint. But you‚Äôre right to be concerned about crosstalk and noise when handling analog signals through these connectors.

Let's look at the issues and solutions:
Noise and Crosstalk on PCB Edge Connectors:

Crosstalk and noise can be an issue, especially with high-density, high-speed signals. However, PCIe-style connectors are used in high-speed computing applications with multi-gigabit data rates, which face similar challenges, so this is manageable with proper design.

Differential Pair Signaling: Using differential signaling for the high-speed digital lines will help mitigate crosstalk on these connectors. PCIe uses differential pairs for this reason, and applying this design principle can help minimize noise.

Ground Pins for Shielding: You could interleave ground pins between signal pins in the connector to reduce crosstalk. For example, for every two signal pins, you could place a ground pin, forming a sort of shield around the signals.

Analog Signal Handling:

For analog connections, using shielded traces or coaxial-like pins (ground-signal-ground) in the edge connector could help isolate the sensitive analog lines from digital signals. Another option is to use twisted pairs for analog signals passing through the connector to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference).

PCB Design Considerations: You‚Äôll want to ensure the traces that lead to and from the connector are kept short and isolated. Use ground planes beneath the traces leading to the connector to help shield them from noise.

Hot-Swappability:

Hot-swappable boards can be achieved by using hot-swap ICs (like TI‚Äôs TPS series) that control the power supply to the board and prevent voltage spikes when plugging/unplugging the boards.

Power Sequencing: To avoid damaging components or introducing noise during hot-swapping, you‚Äôll need to control the power sequencing, ensuring power is stable before analog or digital signals are sent through the connector.

Connector Types:

Standard PCIe connectors could work well if you‚Äôre focusing on digital signals and are familiar with them, but for custom analog/digital hybrid systems, you might want to look at DIN connectors (used in industrial and telecom applications), which offer good support for high-density analog and digital signals.

For example, DIN 41612 connectors are used in many backplane systems where both analog and digital signals need to be handled. These connectors have pins that are isolated well enough to minimize crosstalk and can support hot-swapping.

Combining the Two (Power + Plug-and-Play):
Noise-Reduced Power on Mainboard:

To make this plug-and-play system work with minimal noise, it‚Äôs important that the mainboard supplies clean power. Use filtered power rails and isolated supplies for the analog components to ensure that hot-swapping won‚Äôt introduce noise into the system.
Mainboard Design:

The mainboard itself could handle the clock distribution and power regulation (with clean, low-noise power rails), while each individual modular board handles the ADC/DAC conversions and feeds signals back to the attention mechanism.

The edge connector could also supply regulated voltages and distribute the clock signal to each modular board, allowing for seamless integration.

Final Thoughts:
For power, hybrid solutions (switching regulators for efficiency + linear regulators for low noise) might give you the best balance between size, cost, and noise management. If absolute noise-free performance is a must, then medical-grade power supplies are the way to go.

The PCIe-style connector concept should be feasible for plug-and-play with some attention to signal integrity and crosstalk prevention. Using differential pairs, ground shielding, and careful PCB layout can help minimize issues while keeping things compact and scalable.
