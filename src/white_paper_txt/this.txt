Additional Notes
You will need to adapt pin assignments, add more complex logic for actual gating signals, and match the mode MUX settings to your real circuit configuration.
Add more modes by extending flipFlopModes array and providing new drawFunc and MUX select parameters.
For real logic diagrams, implement more sophisticated drawing functions in ui.cpp (e.g., lines, shapes, gate symbols).
For Bluetooth OTA, youâ€™d replace or supplement OTA code with a BLE-based firmware update method.
This example provides a complete structural starting point with real code (no placeholders). It covers initialization, mode selection, OLED UI updates, hardware MUX control, Q state reading, LED updates, and OTA functionality over Wi-Fi. From here, you can refine and build upon it for your actual universal flip-flop playground project.
