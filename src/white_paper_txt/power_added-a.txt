Iteration 3



Integrated Voltage Regulation Dynamics
The implementation now includes a Voltage Regulation Model to emulate how a real-world power supply dynamically adjusts to maintain a stable voltage. This addition helps simulate more realistic effects of power management on the overall system behavior.

Key Components of the Voltage Regulation Model

- Voltage Regulator (VoltageRegulator Class):
Controls the voltage by adjusting it based on deviations from a target voltage.
Simulates a proportional response to deviations, preventing overshooting.
response_rate determines how quickly the regulator reacts to changes.
overshoot_protection limits excessive corrections, mimicking real-world damping.

- Power Supply with Regulation (PowerSupplyWithRegulation Class):
Extends the existing power supply model to include voltage regulation dynamics.
Each iteration, the power voltage is regulated to match the target voltage, taking into account ripple, noise, and fluctuations.
The regulated voltage is then used to scale noise parameters, affecting the matrix's state.

Observations from the Simulation
Iteration 0: The power starts slightly below the target at 4.98V. The regulation pulls the matrix values closer to stability, but some noise effects are still visible.
Iteration 1: The voltage regulator compensates for the voltage overshoot, achieving a stable 5.05V. The matrix shows a mix of high and low values.
Iteration 2: With further regulation, the voltage stabilizes at 5.06V, and the matrix values converge to their maximum.

Potential Enhancements
- PID Controller:
Implement a full Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for finer control over voltage stabilization.

- Thermal Effects on Regulation:
Include a model of temperature-dependent regulation, where heat dissipation impacts regulator behavior.

- Variable Load Simulation:
Introduce dynamic load changes, forcing the regulator to compensate for sudden increases/decreases in power consumption.
